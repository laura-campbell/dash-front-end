## Dash (Front End)
A travel dashboard to organize your entire itinerary in one easily-accessible, portable place. Keep track of everything involved in a trip - flights, itinerary, packing list, and resources.

## Motivation
This is a student project, created in my final module for Flatiron School's immersive web development program.
